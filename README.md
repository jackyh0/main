## Course Description

When computers first came into prominence, security problems were mostly
thought of as technical ones: vulnerabilities were exploited due to
technical errors—software bugs that needed to be patched. However, as is
demonstrated over and over again, the vast majority of modern software
security issues stem from human factors. For instance, most software
vulnerabilities are exploited because *humans* fail to apply patches in
a timely manner; authentication systems that are difficult to use result
in *humans* choosing weaker passwords (or bypassing security measures
altogether); *humans* are tricked into downloading malware or divulging
credentials via phishing; and Internet traffic is easily intercepted
because *humans* fail to properly use encryption technologies.

As you will learn in this course, despite the fact that many security
problems are caused by human error, in most cases, the users aren’t to
blame. Many security problems exist because software is simply
*unusable*; when software engineers fail to account for the abilities
and expectations of their users, those users will make preventable
errors. Security and privacy systems can be made more usable by
designing them with the user in mind, from the ground up. In this
course, you will learn many of the common pitfalls of designing usable
privacy and security systems, techniques for designing more usable
systems, and how to evaluate privacy and security systems for usability.
Through this course you will learn methods for designing software
systems that are more secure because they minimize the potential for
human error.

## Prerequisites

Completion of at least one of the three core courses for the MICS degree
program or permission of the instructor.

## Course Objectives

1.  > Students will learn to identify human factors issues that impact
    > the security and privacy of systems.

2.  > Students will develop skills reading research papers, evaluating
    > their findings, and identifying their limitations.

3.  > Students will learn multiple experimental approaches to evaluating
    > human factors issues in security and privacy.

4.  > Students will learn about current research findings and methods in
    > usable security and privacy.

## Course Evaluation

  - > Async responses and reflections (10%)

  - > Live session participation (20%)
    
      - > You will lead the discussion of 1-3 papers (depending on
        > course enrollment)

  - > Assignments (10%)
    
      - > Traditional homeworks
    
      - > Acting as reviewer or pilot participant for other teams’
        > course projects

  - > Midterm (20%)

  - > [<span class="underline">Final
    > project</span>](/project/)
    > (40%)

## Collaboration Policy

We encourage studying in groups of two to four people. This applies to
working on homework, discussing material, and studying for the exam.
However, students must always adhere to the UC Berkeley Code of Conduct
(http://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct) and the UC Berkeley Honor Code
(https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code). In particular, all
materials that are turned in for credit or evaluation must be written
solely by the submitting student or group. Similarly, you may consult
books, publications, or online resources to help you study. In the end,
you must always credit and acknowledge all consulted sources in your
submission (including other persons, books, resources, etc.).

## Assignments

When homework is assigned, it will be due two hours before the beginning
of the live session.

## Late Submission Policy

Solutions will be discussed during the live sessions of the course.
Therefore, any assignment that is submitted after the deadline will be
returned without grading and will receive a grade of zero.

## Participation

Participation and taking an active part in every aspect of the course
are key to internalizing the material of the course. Participation
includes, but is not limited to, (i) active participation in live
sessions, (ii) discussing assignments with other students, and/or (iii)
activity in the class forum (by asking questions and/or contributing to
answering other students’ questions).

The instructors will also reward participation credit for those who
choose to live tweet their experiences reading the assigned research
papers (see more in the next section). Tag the tweets with
[<span class="underline">\#uc\_berkeley\_w215</span>](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23uc_berkeley_w215).
We would also encourage you to find the authors’ twitter handles and @
them in your tweet. If you have an insight that you’d rather not be made
public, the class slack channel may be a more appropriate forum to share
those thoughts.

## Readings

Reading and understanding research papers is one of the fundamental
skills you will develop in this course. You are expected to read and be
prepared to discuss all the assigned readings. You will be asked to lead
the discussion of research papers in class.

The instructors selected the papers in the first half of the course
(through Unit 7) to provide key background in the field and inspiration
for your course projects.

In the second half of the class, the instructors will examine students’
project proposals and seek out readings that may serve as important
background for those projects. The instructors may then replace many of
the readings tentatively on the syllabus with those new selected
readings.

When it’s your turn to lead the 10-15 minute discussion of the paper,
you'll want to read the guidelines on [leading paper discussions](/leading-paper-discussions.md).

> your user base?”*
> 
> The class will be split into groups of 3 students, so that each group
> designs a study to examine one of the following products and
> associated usability issues:

1.  > *Phone lock screen software*: users complain about it taking too
    > much time to login.

2.  > *Photo-sharing software*: users complain upon discovering that all
    > of their photos are publicly-accessible.

3.  > *Application Programming Interface (API) for Cryptographic
    > Operations*: a measurement study shows that most applications use
    > the API incorrectly, resulting in insecure software built around
    > the API.

4.  > *Secure messaging software*: users complain about not
    > understanding how to verify that the people with whom they
    > communicate via the software are the people they believe them to
    > be. Some people have even reported cases of impersonation.

5.  > *Social media authentication*: users complain that they cannot log
    > into their accounts when they have multiple devices.

> Please be aware that descriptions above are (purposefully) incomplete;
> use the assigned sync time to attempt to define exactly what is the
> question you would like to have answered to improve your product, and

### A brief note about framing a research problem

In the breakout group projects that we started during class 4 and
presented in class 5, we hope you all learned that:

1.  > Understanding the specifics of a problem is an essential first
    > step and worth your time.

2.  > Different assumptions of costs and benefits can lead to very
    > different research designs.

Therefore, when you are pitching projects ideas, put 80% of your effort
into writing a crisp and clear definition of the problem you want to
investigate or hypothesis you wish to test, and then 20% of effort into
saying which research method (survey, lab study, field study, etc.)
would best apply to the problem.

### Assignments due

  - Submit a proposed course project idea

Share the idea as a Google doc with at least two paragraphs, share a link to it to the course slack channel at least an hour before the sync session, and be prepared to answer questions about what you wrote during the session.

### Synchronous discussion agenda
